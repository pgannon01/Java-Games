## Java-Games
A few games, made as individual packages, to practice Java.

## Games List:

# Brick Breaker
A simple game made using a JFrame that's based off the old game of the same name. The player controls a small paddle 
on the bottom with the arrow keys and trys to keep the ball in the air, while also getting rid of all the boxes on the screen.
If the ball gets past the paddle, the player loses. If the player manages to get the ball to destroy all the boxes, the player wins!

# Flappy Bird Clone
Another simple game based off the famous old game Flappy Bird. While not nearly as pretty as Flappy Bird, it still has the same essential functionality!
The player controls a box on the screen and has to keep it flying in between two pillars. If the player touches either of the pillars, they lose. 
The player controls the box on the screen through either clicking or hitting the space bar.
Currently it has no end and just continues on until the player loses

# Text Based Dungeon Adventure
A very simple game made to be played in a console. The player controls an adventurer exploring a dungeon and fighting enemies. 
The player and enemies both have health, though the player is the only one who can heal through a set amount of health potions, 
though they can find them from defeated enemies!
Eventually the player will either run out of health and be forced to leave, or beat the enemy and be given a choice to continue fighting, or to leave.
